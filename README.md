# Whole-Genome-Sequencing-Disease-Variant-Algorithms
This is a comprehensive list of Whole Genome Sequencing variant analysis algorithms that can be utilized in identification of rare disease variants. I have plans to code algorithms for different variant types, disease types, and phenotypes to then break it down into more specific disease classifications. Anyone can feel free to contribute.
