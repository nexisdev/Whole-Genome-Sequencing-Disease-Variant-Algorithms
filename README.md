# Welcome explorers

My name is Stefan, I've been a bioinformatics scientist for 6+ years now working on my own projects in my spare time as well as industry experience with Shriners Hospital where I worked as their lead bioinformatics scientist to develop the Whole Genomic Sequencing pipeline for rare disease variants.

Thia repository is made up of tools and resources new bioinformatics scientists can use to advance research and explore new possibilities. 

Our mission is to enable further investigation into the identification of sub-groups of gene's and sub-groups of diseases/phenotype severity to potentially point out flaws in our current classification system to further enhance treatment outcomes.

When contributing beware that all code is open source and free to the public. Also include any relevant citations needed in your pull requests.

## Whole-Genome-Sequencing-Disease-Variant-Algorithms
This is a comprehensive list of Whole Genome Sequencing variant analysis algorithms that can be utilized in identification of rare disease variants. I have plans to code algorithms for different variant types, disease types, and phenotypes to then break it down into more specific disease classifications. Anyone can feel free to contribute.

# Types of algorithms

## Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
These algorithms are the elite hackers of the genomic world, trained to find patterns and anomalies that escape the human eye. They can be trained on known disease variants to identify similar patterns in new sequences, using techniques such as deep learning, which has shown exceptional ability in handling complex data structures.

## Variant Calling Algorithms: 
These are the scouts, meticulously analyzing sequencing data to identify variations from a reference genome. Tools like GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit), SAMtools, and FreeBayes are adept at this task, offering a blend of precision and efficiency in detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions that could be linked to rare diseases.

## Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS): 
GWAS operate like the intelligence networks, correlating genetic variants across many individuals to disease phenotypes. This method is powerful for identifying variants with even minor effects on disease risk, although it requires large datasets to achieve statistical significance.

## Sequence Alignment and Assembly Tools: 
Tools such as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and MUMmer are the cryptographers, aligning new sequences with known genomes to uncover hidden variants. These tools are essential for identifying mutations in the context of the entire genome.

## Pathogenicity Prediction Tools: 
Once potential variants are identified, tools like PolyPhen-2 and SIFT dive deeper, analyzing the potential impact of mutations on protein function. They help in distinguishing between benign variations and those likely to cause disease, using databases of known genetic information as their guide.

## Rare Variant Aggregation and Analysis: 
Algorithms like SKAT (Sequence Kernel Association Test) and burden tests aggregate information from multiple rare variants across a gene or genomic region to assess their combined effect on disease risk. This approach is particularly useful for diseases where multiple rare variants contribute to the phenotype.

Our mission is to enable further investigation into the identification of sub-groups of gene's and sub-groups of diseases/phenotype severity to potentially point out flaws in our current classification system to further enhance treatment outcomes.
